# React Native Assignment 6

This repository contains a React Native application for a simple shopping app assignment. Below are details about the project, including design choices, implementation details, and instructions for running the app locally.

## Design Choices

### UI Design

The UI design follows modern mobile app principles with the following components:

- **HomeScreen:** Displays a list of products with an "Add to Cart" button.
- **CartScreen:** Shows selected items with a "Remove" button for each.

Icons from an icon package are used for buttons to enhance user interaction.

### Data Storage

Local storage is implemented using AsyncStorage from React Native:

- **AsyncStorage:** Used to store and retrieve cart items locally on the device.
